Hello, I'm Masha, I'm 25 years old. And I survived the first stage. This is my third attempt and the longest one.

Right now (February 11th), I'm working on my thesis, defense is on February 22nd. My major is not related to programming - I'm getting a degree in social work.

I've had to put aside tasks because of my studies, but it seems like March will bring plenty of free time.

I don't remember how my programming journey began, it was somewhere around 2021-2022. I took a Python course on Stepik. By the way, it helped me land a job - now I teach at one of the programming schools for children. It's a very strange feeling because I still feel like a complete beginner.

I've worked as a youth worker, courier, copywriter, and tutor at different times.

In the summer, I was unexpectedly invited to an internship. I understand it's probably like searching for "hungry, inexperienced, and desperate" individuals, but it ignited something in me. And from the start of that course, I managed to go this far.

After defending my thesis, I plan to refactor/finish projects and try to apply for that internship by the end of March. Besides that, I'm compiling a list of other places where I could try to apply around the same time or a little later.

Thank you and have a great day!
