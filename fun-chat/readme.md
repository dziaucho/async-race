wow, set up webpack + linter take just 10-15 minutes????

AWSOME!!!11!!

---

i don't know am i will finish this or not, but i'm back

---

how it can be possible to write code < 40 strings???

in my opinion it became more messy and unreadable

like, i know i can put valid functions (or other huge file) in different files and folders, but it looks more ugly than now, isn't it?

---

i'm sooooooooo lazy for creating svg element, so all image will be png, lol

---

erlier i tryed to create style rules befor interactivity, but now i do it after
hmmm

i kinda feel this work style is better. like, i can waste HOURS just for looking colors, font, etc. somtimes i like it, sometimes don't

but i can do it much more faster than js/ts. and, probably, it's truely better to do it later

top 3 annoying staff:

3 when gpt start using "ты", instead "вы"
2 when i need fix smth, instead do smth
1 when after run project i see this red "REPLACE BLA BLA BLA WITH BLA BLA BLA"

like, who is a machine? me? you? did you see problem? did you know how fix this? so, maybe you fix it, so i can do more harder, important and interesting staff????

---

about section is a cringe joke, but i like it

---

with all this files when i work i have a billion opened tabs, kekw

---

all i know about ts:

— ": type" everywhere;
— "<T(??????)>" for smth 'cos without this i have errors;

that's all

---

i need SO MANY buttons in header, i tired

i realize that instead 4 files for buttons i can just create a function with arguments... but i realized it when i wrote 4 files

this is the reason i get tired

like, i know that mistakes are helpful(?), but my mana for correct them is over

I CAN WRITE THIS ADD AND REMOVE CLASS ACTS RIGHT IN THE PLACE WHERE I NEED, IT TOOK EVEN LESS STRINGS, ARRRRRRRRR

i need someone to show me correct arc and explain what and why

---

i don't care it look's ugly, ok?
