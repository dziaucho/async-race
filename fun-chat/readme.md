AWSOME!!!11!!

i don't know am i will finish this or not, but i'm back

how it can be possible to write code < 40 strings???

in my opinion it became more messy and unreadable

like, i know i can put valid functions (or other huge file) in different files and folders, but it looks more ugly than now, isn't it?

i'm sooooooooo lazy for creating svg element, so all image will be png, lol

erlier i tryed to create style rules befor interactivity, but now i do it after
hmmm

i kinda feel this work style is better. like, i can waste HOURS just for looking colors, font, etc. somtimes i like it, sometimes don't

but i can do it much more faster than js/ts. and, probably, it's truely better to do it later
